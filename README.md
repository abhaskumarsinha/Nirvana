*Dispel the ignorance of the illusionary world; transcend the game engine!*: presenting a Game Engine written on Python, extending support across multiple GPU devices with 3D rendering, PBR Renderer and much more!
# The Engine is Currently WIP!! ⚠️

## Abstract
**Nirvana 3D** is an experimental 3D graphics and game engine written in Python, built to explore the fundamentals of 3D rendering and engine design. Designed initially for offline rendering, Nirvana 3D can import and render 3D OBJ models with basic materials and lighting. The engine currently focuses on educational purposes, providing a platform for understanding and developing essential 3D engine components before transitioning to real-time rendering.
### Features
- **3D Model Import**: Supports importing 3D OBJ models with UV mapping for texture and material rendering.
- **Rendering Techniques**: Renders scenes using solid face rendering and Lambert shading, simulating diffuse lighting.
- **Camera Systems**: Supports both orthographic and perspective cameras, offering flexibility for various visual perspectives.
- **Basic Lighting**: Implements sunlight-based directional lighting to simulate environmental lighting.
- **Transformations**: Supports transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling for models and objects within the scene.
- **Visualization**: Renders directly to Python’s `matplotlib`, allowing easy visualization of 3D scenes even in environments without a dedicated graphics API.
### Future Development
Nirvana 3D is in its early stages, with plans to enhance performance and extend its capabilities, including:

- **GPU Acceleration**: Shift from CPU-bound rendering to GPU-based processing for real-time rendering performance.
- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**: Introduce advanced shading models and PBR for realistic lighting and material rendering.
- **Additional Lighting Types**: Expand beyond directional lighting to support point, spot, and area lights.
- **User Controls**: Add advanced interactivity with camera and object manipulation controls.
- **Collision Detection**: Incorporate collision detection for basic physics interactions within the engine.
Nirvana 3D aims to eventually evolve into a versatile, Python-powered 3D engine for educational and experimental purposes. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to help shape its future!
